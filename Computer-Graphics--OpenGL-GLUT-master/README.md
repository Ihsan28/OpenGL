# Computer-Graphics--OpenGL-GLUT
# Some basic implementation of OpenGL with GLUT is stored here.
These are the works of different students of Computer Graphics course taught in AIUB from different semester. 
These codes are the intellectual property of the students who developed the applications hosted in this repository.
The concern from the students have been taken to showcase these works in the world wide web.
If you want to use these codes for learning purpose I encourage you to use this repo and if you wish to modify any one of the applications from this repo, please
be sure to give proper credits to the developers and post a merge request here.
If you use these codes as it is for any academic requirement completion purpose (projects, assignments, lab works) you are liable for
the plagariasm and it is unethical to demonstrate others' work as your own.
Enjoy learning!
